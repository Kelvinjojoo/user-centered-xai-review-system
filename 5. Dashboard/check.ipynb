       "2  A tourist site with the soul of a TGI Friday s We had a couple Peacemaker Po Boys but apparently the shrimp were enforcing peace through total domination of the oysters One of the sandwiches had nary a single oyster on an entire half Bread was so so Actually had a much better Po at the Royal House where they also have great chargrilled oysters ACME s are OK but they have too much cheese on them Folks inside Acme were very nice and efficient but the line guardian pissed us off We were four it was raining and one person was sick She went a half block to the hotel to get a coat and be warm so we could call her when it was our turn to be seated They would not take us until she was there and kept pulling groups from behind us in line So she arrived in five minutes and had to wait again in line anyway I get that you cannot just hold empty tables but that was not the case and we explained nicely Losers There are too many places for good oysters like Drago s to waste time with Acme s shtick   \n",

       "2  A tourist site with the soul of a TGI Friday's. We had a couple Peacemaker Po' Boys, but apparently the shrimp were enforcing peace through total domination of the oysters. One of the sandwiches had nary a single oyster on an entire half. Bread was so so. \\nActually had a much better Po' at the Royal House, where they also have great chargrilled oysters. \\nACME's are OK, but they have too much cheese on them. Folks inside Acme were very nice and efficient, but the line guardian pissed us off. We were four, it was raining, and one person was sick. She went a half block to the hotel to get a coat and be warm so we could call her when it was our turn to be seated. They wouldn't take us until she was there and kept pulling groups from behind us in line. So she arrived in five minutes and had to wait again in line anyway. I get that you can't just hold empty tables, but that wasn't the case, and we explained nicely. Losers. There are too many places for good oysters (like Drago's) to waste time with Acme's shtick.  \n",

We went early to beat the incredibly long lines (I really don't get it). I had a fried half and half platter, shrimp and oysters. It was perfectly fine. The shrimp were lightly fried and not at all greasy. The wife had the \"peacemaker\" po boy (fried oysters and shrimp, the mayo is infused with tabasco). She loved it. My coleslaw was way above average. We both loved the dozen chargrilled oysters, they were excellent. The cups of beer were very small for $4. Looked like 6-8 oz, no more. Overall, this place was perfectly fine. As one review said, there is nothing healthy to eat here, but it is fun.  \n",

Although there was a line, I was able to walk right in for a seat at the oyster bar. \\n\\nThe Char grilled oysters were outstanding! Served breaded and grilled in garlic. The seafood Gumbo was also delicious. \\n\\nI'll be back  "

       "      <td>A tourist site with the soul of a TGI Friday's. We had a couple Peacemaker Po' Boys, but apparently the shrimp were enforcing peace through total domination of the oysters. One of the sandwiches had nary a single oyster on an entire half. Bread was so so. \\nActually had a much better Po' at the Royal House, where they also have great chargrilled oysters. \\nACME's are OK, but they have too much cheese on them. Folks inside Acme were very nice and efficient, but the line guardian pissed us off. We were four, it was raining, and one person was sick. She went a half block to the hotel to get a coat and be warm so we could call her when it was our turn to be seated. They wouldn't take us until she was there and kept pulling groups from behind us in line. So she arrived in five minutes and had to wait again in line anyway. I get that you can't just hold empty tables, but that wasn't the case, and we explained nicely. Losers. There are too many places for good oysters (like Drago's) to waste time with Acme's shtick.</td>\n",

It was perfectly fine. The shrimp were lightly fried and not at all greasy. The wife had the \"peacemaker\" po boy (fried oysters and shrimp, the mayo is infused with tabasco). She loved it. My coleslaw was way above average. We both loved the dozen chargrilled oysters, they were excellent. The cups of beer were very small for $4. Looked like 6-8 oz, no more.

At the age of 15, I dined three days in a row to try and distinguish the flavors in their seafood gumbo. On the third day, after badgering the staff, they finally told me the one ingredient I missed. Fantastic gumbo.\\n\\nThe chargrilled oysters are wonderful. The fresh shucked oysters are flavorful.\\n\\nTry the seafood gumbo with whatever else you order.\\n\\nThe fried softshell crab po-boy and platter are also great.\\n\\nLines here can be long so come early.  \n",
       "3  A tourist site with the soul of a TGI Friday's. We had a couple Peacemaker Po' Boys, but apparently the shrimp were enforcing peace through total domination of the oysters. One of the sandwiches had nary a single oyster on an entire half. Bread was so so. \\nActually had a much better Po' at the Royal House, where they also have great chargrilled oysters. \\nACME's are OK, but they have too much cheese on them. Folks inside Acme were very nice and efficient, but the line guardian pissed us off. We were four, it was raining, and one person was sick. She went a half block to the hotel to get a coat and be warm so we could call her when it was our turn to be seated. They wouldn't take us until she was there and kept pulling groups from behind us in line. So she arrived in five minutes and had to wait again in line anyway. I get that you can't just hold empty tables, but that wasn't the case, and we explained nicely. Losers. There are too many places for good oysters (like Drago's) to waste time with Acme's shtick.  \n",

We went early to beat the incredibly long lines (I really don't get it). I had a fried half and half platter, shrimp and oysters. It was perfectly fine. The shrimp were lightly fried and not at all greasy. The wife had the \"peacemaker\" po boy (fried oysters and shrimp, the mayo is infused with tabasco). She loved it. My coleslaw was way above average. We both loved the dozen chargrilled oysters, they were excellent. The cups of beer were very small for $4. Looked like 6-8 oz, no more. Overall, this place was perfectly fine. As one review said, there is nothing healthy to eat here, but it is fun.  "

       "2681  Like dodgy Asian massage places, they are still offering services even when the light is off. The website and Yelp review say they're open at 11, but the door is open earlier than when the electric light goes on... so don't be a pleb. Grab your friends (or leave their drunk asses and go) to beat the rush.\\n\\nIf you were part of the group that was passed out from a hard night on Bourbon Street, go check the line out 3:30PM. If the line is still ghastly and you don't have another day there, ultimately wait or eat somewhere else... the line don't get better Saturday after that.\\n\\nChargrilled oysters are a must. A shucker told me they all mostly have the same suppliers, so you could get your raw oysters pretty much anywhere. Anyway, getting half a dozen chargrilled is a pretty dumb move since you are probably gonna need 12! 12 for $20. If you don't want to wait in a line, go check out Deanie's or Felix's for amazing chargrilled oysters, too. (Warning! Lots of Deanie's other stuff is mehhhhhhh)\\n\\nThis place loses a star for service... While everyone was politely nice, I can tell that the shuckers in front of me were really tired of dealing with tourists. I didn't feel that when sitting at the bar with the shuckers at Felix's.  \n",
